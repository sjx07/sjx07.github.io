<!-- About
====== -->
---

I am currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Kexin Rong](https://kexinrong.github.io/). Previously, I earned my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2024, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Shixuan Sun](https://shixuansun.github.io/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of databases and machine learning, particularly how large language models can be used for data-centric tasks.
